## 🚀 Installation

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) 
For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate AirKit into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'AirKit', '~> 0.8'
```

### [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `AirKit` as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yurii-lysytsia/AirKit", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.8.0"))
]
```

## 💻 Usage 

### 1. Swizzle (not mandatory)
Some features of `AirKit` are needed of method swizzling. So you can use code below to swizzle easily.

```swift
import AirKit

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    ...
    do {
        try AirKit.swizzle()
    } catch {
        // Catch some error of `AirKit` swizzling if needed.
        // You can use `try? AirKit.swizzle()` if you don't need catch error
    }
    ...
}
```

### 2. Import `AirKit` to the file and use extensions that you need.
```swift
import AirKit
```
